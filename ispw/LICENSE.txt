BY OPENING THE PACKAGE, INSTALLING, CLICKING "AGREE" OR "YES", DOWNLOADING, OR USING THE BMC CONNECTOR AND/OR
THE MATERIALS WITHIN THE BMC CONNECTOR, THE ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AGREES TO BE BOUND
BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND THE TERMS OF ANY THIRD-PARTY FILES OR PROGRAMS EMBEDDED IN BMC CONNECTOR (SUCH
THIRD-PARTY TERMS ARE FOUND IN THE APPLICABLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS, RELEASE NOTES, TEXT FILE, OR DISTRIBUTION
FILE). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE BMC CONNECTOR. IF YOU REJECT THIS
AGREEMENT, YOU WILL NOT ACQUIRE ANY LICENSE TO USE THE BMC CONNECTOR.

This License Agreement ("Agreement") is an agreement between the entity or individual entering into this Agreement ("Licensee")
and BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BMC"), located at 2103 CityWest Blvd., Houston, Texas 77042. In addition to the
restrictions imposed under this Agreement, any other usage restrictions contained in the BMC Connector's installation instructions
and release notes shall apply to Licensee's use of the BMC Connector and all materials contained therein.


1. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement governs Licensee's use of BMC code that connects certain BMC products to third party
products, including but not limited to Microsoft Visual Studio (such BMC code in each instance, a "BMC Connector"). Licensee may
not access or use the BMC Connector if it is a direct competitor of BMC, unless otherwise authorized by BMC to do so in writing.

2. LICENSE. Subject to this Agreement, BMC grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable (per
Section 3 of this Agreement), and royalty-free right under trade secrets rights and copyrights to install, access and use the BMC
Connector (i) for Licensee's internal business operations and (ii) in accordance with any documentation provided with the BMC
Connector (the "Documentation").

3. RESTRICTIONS. Licensee will not: (a) modify, delete or remove any ownership, title, trademark, patent or copyright notices from
the BMC Connector, or copy or make a partial copy of the BMC Connector; (b) disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise
attempt to derive any BMC Connector source code from object code, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law
despite this limitation without possibility of contractual waiver; (c) provide a third party with the results of any functional evaluation,
or performance tests, without BMC's prior written approval; or (d) attempt to disable or circumvent any of the licensing mechanisms
within the BMC Connector.

4. TERMINATION. This Agreement terminates automatically if Licensee breaches any of its terms. Either party may terminate this
Agreement without cause. Upon termination, Licensee must cease use of the BMC Connector and the BMC Connector must be
promptly destroyed and removed from any computer system.

5. OWNERSHIP. BMC, or its affiliates or licensors, retains all right, title, and interest in the BMC Connector and copies thereof, and
any intellectual property, informational, industrial property, and proprietary rights therein. The BMC Connector is protected by
applicable copyright and trade secret rights and may be protected by patent and other intellectual and industrial property laws. BMC
neither grants to Licensee any license to any BMC patents nor transfers any rights of ownership in the BMC Connector to Licensee.
BMC reserves any rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement.

6. CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. The BMC Connector contains valuable confidential information and trade
secrets of BMC. Licensee agrees to use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, publication, or dissemination
of the BMC Connector. Licensee may not disclose the BMC Connector or any part thereof to any third party; provided, however,
Licensee may disclose the BMC Connector, or parts thereof, to Licensee's employees provided that such employee (i) is one that needs
to receive the disclosure of the BMC Connector in order to install, use, support or maintain the BMC Connector and (ii) has obligations
of confidentiality with regard to the BMC Connector, which are at least as protective of BMC's confidential information and trade
secrets as the provisions of this Agreement.

7. INDEMNIFICATION. If a third party asserts a Claim (as defined herein) against BMC, Licensee will at its own expense defend or
settle the Claim and indemnify and hold harmless BMC, its affiliates, and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers,
directors, and representatives from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning Licensee's use of the BMC Connector in violation of this
Agreement (a "Claim"). Licensee will not bind BMC to a monetary obligation in a settlement or compromise, or make an admission
on behalf of BMC, without obtaining BMC's prior consent.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. THE BMC CONNECTOR IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH ALL FAULTS. BMC, ITS AFFILIATES, AND
LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT. BMC DOES NOT WARRANT
THAT THE OPERATION OF THE BMC CONNECTOR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR VIRUS OR ERROR FREE, THAT THERE ARE NO DEFECTS,
OR THAT ANY DEFECT IN SUCH CAN BE CORRECTED.

9. LIMITS ON BMC'S LIABILITY. NEITHER BMC, ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE USE OF THE BMC
CONNECTOR, OR ANY THIRD PARTY CODE OR SOFTWARE PROVIDED WITH THE BMC CONNECTOR (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
LOST PROFITS, LOST COMPUTER USAGE TIME, AND DAMAGE TO, OR LOSS OF USE OF DATA), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY NEGLIGENCE OF BMC OR WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A CLAIM ARISING
UNDER TORT OR CONTRACT LAW. BMC'S LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR INFRINGEMENT
CLAIMS, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE BMC CONNECTOR, IF ANY, AND (II) $500.

10. VERIFICATION. If requested by BMC, Licensee will deliver to BMC written certification relating to Licensee's use of the BMC
Connector in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. BMC may audit Licensee's use of the BMC Connector to confirm such
compliance.

11. EXPORT CONTROLS. Both parties agree to comply with applicable export regulations, including but not limited to U.S. Export
Administration Regulations and the OFAC embargoes and sanctions lists. More information on BMC's export compliance program may

subject to this Agreement by or on behalf of the United States Government, or by any prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier)
under any contract, grant, agreement or other activity with the United States Government. When products are delivered or provided
to the United States Government, the United States Government agrees that this commercial license Agreement and the products
governed by this Agreement are defined in accordance with and qualify as "commercial items" consisting of "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as outlined in FAR 12.211, FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.202-3, as
applicable. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall pertain to the United States Government's use (including documentation
or technical data), duplication, and disclosure of the BMC Connector, and shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms and
conditions.

14. DATA PROTECTION. (a) Licensee acknowledges that BMC neither requires nor needs Licensee to (i) send BMC any personal data
collected by Licensee ("Licensee Collected Data") or (ii) give BMC access to any Licensee Collected Data. Consequently, Licensee
remains responsible for either filtering, making anonymous, encrypting such Licensee Collected Data or for having proper procedures
in place to prevent Licensee Collected Data from being sent to or accessed by BMC. (b) In the course of normal business, BMC may
collect and process personal information related to the Licensee (mainly contact and related information) in order to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, such information being referred to hereinafter as "Licensee Contact Information". Where the
Licensee Contact Information is to be processed by BMC, BMC will comply with its Controller and Processor Binding Corporate Rules
Policy found at http://media.cms.bmc.com/documents/External+Privacy+Binding+Coporate+Rules+Policy+-+Aug+04.pdf (the "BCR")
with respect to compliance with data protection laws and/or regulations. The BCR policy is incorporated into a BMC corporate wide
policy, requiring all BMC entities, employees and third party providers to comply with and respect the BCR policy, which is governing
the collection, use, access, storage and transfer of personal data among BMC entities and third-party sub-processors. The details of
the BCR approval of BMC Software are available at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/bindingcorporate-rules/bcr_cooperation/index_en.htm. BMC shall in particular: (i) allow Licensee to access, modify, correct or erase Licensee
Contact Information when necessary; (ii) take reasonable technical and organizational security measures to maintain the
confidentiality and integrity of Licensee Contact Information and to prevent its unauthorized access, use, or disclosure; and (iii) refrain
from using Licensee Contact Information for any other purpose than performing its obligations under this Agreement.

15. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS. This is the entire agreement of the parties, and it supersedes and replaces all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and negotiations with respect to this subject matter. There are no representations, promises,
warranties, covenants, or undertakings between the parties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement
may only be amended by a signed writing of the parties. Licensee may not assign or transfer this Agreement without BMC's prior
written consent. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement. If any part of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to the extent necessary to
eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and the remaining terms will be in full force and effect. The BMC Connector may contain
third party software which is delivered to Licensee as part of the BMC Connector and may not be taken out of the BMC Connector or
used separately from the BMC Connector and for which additional terms may be included in the Documentation. The BMC Connector
may contain hyperlinks to websites controlled by parties other than BMC. BMC is not responsible for and does not endorse the content
or accept any responsibility for Licensee's use of these websites. During the term of this Agreement and in compliance with all
applicable laws and for internal purposes only, BMC may compile and use information related to Licensee's use of the BMC Connector,
for the purposes of: (a) enhancing and improving BMC's products or technology, developing new products and technology, and for
other development, diagnostic, statistical and corrective purposes; and (b) better informing the Licensee of relevant products. Licensee
should refer to the policies posted by other websites regarding data privacy and other topics before using them. The parties have
